Beginner:

This is one of two homework assignments you can complete for this week (you must do two,
you may do all three for extra credit). This is geared towards those of you who have never
worked with javascript before.

Your assignment should be in the form of an HTML page, which I will be able to run locally.
Refer to the file 'js_in_webpage.html' on the github page for instructions on setting up
javascript to run on an HTML page, and how to run/debug.

You should complete both of these in 2 (or more) functions on one HTML page

Create a function to reverse any word that you type in. This can be typed into either an input
box or an alert box, and then print the result in a box or on the webpage.

Create a function that takes an input number, and prints a table with the first 20 multiples of
the number, in order 5x4

example: type in 2 and it results in:

<table>

<tr><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>16</td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>20</td><td>22</td><td>24</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>28</td><td>30</td><td>32</td></tr>

<tr><td>34</td><td>36</td><td>38</td><td>40</td></tr>

</table>

Write a function to load the presidents.csv data and display the data as an html table (you
may use a cdv parser from any available library, though I encourage you to try the d3 one).

Now that you have the presidents data loaded, write a function that will return that
presidentâ€™s height & weight when you type it in. This can be typed into either an input box or
an alert box, and then print the result in a box or on the webpage.

Deployment: Your apps from parts 1 and 2 must be deployed. There are a lot of options for
deploying javascript apps, however I would recommend using github pages. Read more
