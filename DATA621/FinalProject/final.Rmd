# Abstract  
With the rise of inflation, tangible assets like property provide the type of assets to weather economies afflicted with high inflation indices. Along with market conditions, house buyers and sellers desire the optimal value for their sales and purchases. The purpose of this paper is to examine the housing prices of King County, Washington. Is it possible to predict or at least to obtain a good estimation of a house sale with each of its inherent characteristics? Does the number of bedrooms and/or the area the house resides influence its housing price? If such hypotheses can be proven, is it possible to develop a model to predict the price of a house?  

This paper will examine the house prices for King County from May 2014 to May 2015. It was obtained from Kaggle. Notable variables such as number of bedrooms and square footage will be examined to identify potential correlations with housing price. I will explore the data with R and implement multiple linear regression to determine if a model can be developed to predict housing prices. This will be done by searching for correlations and eliminating unnecessary variables. The model will be developed by splitting the data 80/20 for training and testing.
